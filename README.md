# Agritech_USGS_LIDAR

This projects aims to produce an easy to use, reliable and well designed python package that enables end user to engage with 3DEP's geospatial data.

LiDAR or light detection and ranging, is a popular remote sensing method used for measuring the exact distance of an object on the earthâ€™s surface. Laser scanners and GPS accommodate for the information and they yield geographical data. This geographical data is then configured and processed though GeoPandas for simplicity. GeoPandas currently implements GeoSeries and GeoDataFrame types which are subclasses of pandas.Series and pandas.DataFrame respectively. GeoPandas objects can act on shapely geometry objects and perform geometric operations.

The Purpose of this project is to help users retrieve these data and enable them to use it easily, so that they can better understand farmlands and their relations with different factors like elevation, water, soil, and more.
